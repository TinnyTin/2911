# Subscriberfier
by - DevOps13 

***
Subscriberfier is an interactive web app based on Flask for managing
subscriptions. 

It manages the user's vast and confusing list of subscriptions that they
accumulate for various services, keeping a simple and easy to maintain 
list that is available to the user. 

It allows the user to :
  - Add a subscription
  - Delete a subscription
  - Edit a subscription
  - Update a subscription
  - Sort subscriptions

It also helps the user to easily sum up how much money they are spending
on these subscriptions as well as letting the user know when it is 
going to be renewed.

*** 
The subscriberfier app is deployed at : https://subscriberfier.herokuapp.com/
